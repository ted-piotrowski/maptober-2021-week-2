# Annual Strava activities - Maptober Week 2

Custom vector tile set displaying all Strava activities

## Setup

1. Visit https://www.strava.com/settings/api

    1. Application Name: Maptober, 
    2. Category: Visualizer
    3. Website: example.org
    4. Authorisation Callback Domain: localhost

2. Upload icon
3. Copy Client ID and Client Secret into `.example.env` 
4. Rename `.example.env` to `.env`

5. `yarn install`

## Download activities

Each activity will download into the `/activities` directory as an individual file named `[activityID].json`. The file will be in GeoJSON format. If an activity does not contain Lat/Lng coordinates, the corresponding `[activityID].json` file will be empty.

`./node_modules/.bin/tsc index.ts && node index.js activities`

**Rate Limit:** Strava API rate limit is 100 requests/hr. The script will terminate and a `Rate Limit Exceeded` message will appear. Wait 1hr and run the script again. Only activities not already in the `/activities` folder will be downloaded.

## Combine activities into one GeoJSON

Pass the name of the activities directory as an argument to `combine.js` along with activity type `Run` and the desired output file `run.js`. This script will also add a line from Bothell to the start of each activity.

`./node_modules/.bin/tsc combine.ts && node combine.js activities Run run.json`

## Upload to Mapbox Tiling Service (MTS)

`pip3 install mapbox-tilesets`

export MAPBOX_

Confirm that combined.json is valid line-delimited GeoJSON `tilesets validate-source ted-activites/combined.json` (Always fails even if it's valid)

## Problems

Problem: Strava limited to 100 API requests/hr. 
Solved: Downloaded activities over several hours.

Problem: Some Strava activities like gym workouts, rock climbing, manual entries will not have LatLng coordinates. 
Solved: Ignored these activities.

Problem: Mapbox only allows primitive values in tile delimited JSON, while Strava uses arrays and objects. For example `{ start_lat_lng: [12, -122.2]}`. 
Solved: Put everything in one FeatureCollection and MTS automatically converted to valid tile delimited JSON.
